# Wall Drawing

## Codecademy Project

Letâ€™s draw some patterns to create a digital wall drawing inspired by the artist Sol LeWitt using p5.js!

[Sol LeWitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_LeWitt) (1928-2007) was an American artist known for his Wall Drawings, of which he made over 1,200 in his lifetime. Each Wall Drawing was accompanied by a set of instructions that allowed others to recreate the piece. The instructions detailed the position, shape, and color of elements in the drawing. His instructions left much open to interpretation so that no two installations were identical. His work holds an important place in the modern art movement, where anyone can be an artist.

Together we will create a visualization that is inspired by the work of Sol LeWitt and write instructions using the p5.js shape functions for the computer to draw on the screen.
